## Creating Human-Machine Artificial Intelligence

Our vision is to build a Human-Based Artificial Intelligence, which can solve problems that neither humans nor computers can solve alone. The first application of this technology is a product ecosystem which collects, annotates, and trains machine learning models to recognize any object in images or other data. Access our AI services here, today.

### Microwork App

Microwork is our globally distributed task system where anyone with a smart phone can earn money with simple tasks like taking a photo. Users find tasks and earn Ether, which can then be converted to the local currency. An example task would be, say, take photos of dogs. These images are then given to our image annotation team which distinguishes what is in the photo so that we can build a strong dataset. In this way we’ve created “in the wild” data, real data found in the world, as a basis for training our machine learning models.
