## Creating Human-Machine Artificial Intelligence

Our vision is to build a programmable Human-Based Artificial Intelligence, able to solve problems that neither humans nor computers can solve alone. The first application of this technology is a full-stack Computer Vision product which collects, annotates and creates datasets which allow AI to recognize any objects in unseen images or videos. Access our AI services <a href="https://www.generalblockchain.com/">here</a>, today.

## Products

Our first product is building an AI ecosystem which collects, annotates, and trains machine learning models to recognize any object in images or other data.

## Microwork App

Microwork is our globally distributed task system where anyone with a smart phone can earn money with simple tasks like taking a photo. Users find tasks and earn Ether, which can then be converted to the local currency. An example task would be, say, take photos of dogs. These images are then given to our image annotation team which distinguishes what is in the photo so that we can build a strong dataset. In this way we’ve created “in the wild” data, real data found in the world, as a basis for training our machine learning models.

### Semantic Segmentation

Every pixel in an image is painstakingly masked by our in house team of talented human cloud workers. Combine their skills with your knowledge to make the most valuable data.

### Instance Segmentation

Masks are highly accurate and beautiful and are made by skilled professionals. Bounding Boxes can be upgraded to Masks only if required, make only the Masks you need.

### Bounding Boxes

Bounding Boxes are quick and cheap to make, especially with experience. Labelling boxes sometimes requires domain expertise, we have experts in house, or bring your own.

## Dataset Studio

Dataset Studio creates large and diverse annotated image datasets in order to accelerate AI development, machine learning, and business intelligence. We created Dataset Studio in order to show our datasets live in a web browser to our clients, customers, and partners. We created ways to filter by dataset, classes, and attributes, which are facets of images. For example, a dataset can be fashion, a class would be dresses, and attribute might be the type of dress, hem line, or style. Dataset Studio is live, and you can view our annotated datasets in your browser now.

## Machine Learning Service

Using our advanced, hybrid human-computer intelligence services ecosystem, we combine all of our assets to create superior, accurate machine learning models. We can demonstrate and visualize the specific accuracies and learnings of the model as it is trained, in our web console. You don’t need to worry about how to train a model because we can do it for you. You can hire us to do the entire process or just the part you need. Feel free to contact us for a free quote.
