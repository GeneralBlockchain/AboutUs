## Creating Human-Machine Artificial Intelligence

Our vision is to build a programmable Human-Based Artificial Intelligence, able to solve problems that neither humans nor computers can solve alone. The first application of this technology is a full-stack Computer Vision product which collects, annotates and creates datasets which allow AI to recognize any objects in unseen images or videos. Access our AI services <a href="https://www.generalblockchain.com/">here</a>, today.

### Microwork App

Microwork is our globally distributed task system where anyone with a smart phone can earn money with simple tasks like taking a photo. Users find tasks and earn Ether, which can then be converted to the local currency. An example task would be, say, take photos of dogs. These images are then given to our image annotation team which distinguishes what is in the photo so that we can build a strong dataset. In this way we’ve created “in the wild” data, real data found in the world, as a basis for training our machine learning models.

#### Semantic Segmentation

Every pixel in an image is painstakingly masked by our in house team of talented human cloud workers. Combine their skills with your knowledge to make the most valuable data.

#### Instance Segmentation

Masks are highly accurate and beautiful and are made by skilled professionals. Bounding Boxes can be upgraded to Masks only if required, make only the Masks you need.

#### Bounding Boxes

Bounding Boxes are quick and cheap to make, especially with experience. Labelling boxes sometimes requires domain expertise, we have experts in house, or bring your own.
